          For the 30-year-old Scotsman the race went well. Despite stiff
          competition from a strong field of competitors, he and his Red Bull
          teammate Sebastian Job emerged victorious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only they weren't really at the race track in Sao Paulo back in
          November. No-one was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carroll was back in the UK, plying his trade in the competitive world
          of e-sports. A professional e-sports race car driver, he pocketed
          $1,200 (Â£860) for the win.

          Even before Covid-19 arrived, the world of competitive e-sports had
          built up huge viewer numbers, with people watching events on their
          computers around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the pandemic hit, most of us were stuck at home, and audience
          figures rose even higher.

          Last year, 435.9 million people around the world watched e-sports
          events,
          <strong

              >according to figures from NewZoo, a market research group that
              focuses on the sector.</a
            ></strong
          >
          That was 10% more than 397 million in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, e-sports worldwide revenues hit $947m in 2020,
          driven by sponsorship from the likes of Coca-Cola, Gillette and Nike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The start of the pandemic last year gave e-sports an unexpected boost,
          because with much professional sport paused, many real world players
          started to try their hand at the virtual versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of Formula 1, drivers such as Max Verstappen, Lando
          Norris, Carlos Sainz and George Russell swapped their cars for gaming
          rigs.
        </p>

          While in football, Gareth Bale, then of Real Madrid, and now of
          Tottenham, was one of many to pick up a gaming controller. And some
          football clubs formed their own e-sport teams, such as Manchester
          City, and Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon.

        <p>
          Carroll, himself a former real world driver in the Formula Ford
          classification, says it gave e-sports a big boost.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When the pandemic hit, for the first few months of it, so many
          e-sports championships started with real-life drivers, and [existing
          e-sports] drivers racing against each other," he says. "It was
          brilliant. The viewing numbers really grew... now there are people
          hooked on e-sports. It opened a few people's eyes."
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam Deutsch, an e-sports expert at business consultancy group
          Deloitte, says the pandemic "turbocharged" the sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We saw exponential, deep double-digit growth, with events,
          sponsorship, prize money, team formation, and new leagues. It was all
          turbocharged."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Deutsch's comments were echoed by Giuseppe Guastella, who plays the
          football video game Fifa professionally for US side Los Angeles
          Galaxy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's grown a lot, and the prizes have gotten so much better than in
          previous years," he says. "Now there are multiple [football]
          competitions, and the prize pool is $1m to $2m throughout the season,
          it is going to keep growing and growing."

          Ivan Curtiss, general manager and coach of the e-sports side of US
          basketball franchise Brooklyn Nets, says the pandemic has changed the
          perception of gaming in general, opening it up to more people.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In the past, people have been criticised for staying in the house and
          playing video games for hours," he says.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But people are now realising that individuals are out there making a
          living from video games."
        </p>
        <p>
          Rob Kingyens says it is important to remember that it is not just the
          players who can make money from e-sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is the founder and chief executive of Yellowbrick, an online
          learning platform that last year launched a gaming and e-sports course
          in collaboration with New York's Fashion Institute of Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Games have evolved to be more complex and nuanced... all this means
          more jobs, more specialisation, a richer ecosystem," he says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Kingyens adds that this means that game developers can typically
          make up to $132,000 a year.

          Meanwhile, Robert Rippee, a director of the International Gaming
          Institute at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, says e-sports have
          been boosted by professional real world teams setting up gaming
          divisions as an additional way of engaging with existing fans, and
          perhaps creating new ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a smart move," he says. "From a strategy perspective it gives
          them a new audience that may not have engaged with them at all, or at
          the same level, through their traditional media channels. Video games
          are also not seasonable."
        </p>
        <p>
          But with the pandemic hopefully going to end this year, and the world
          returning to normal, is the growth of e-sports sustainable when people
          are able to attending real world supporting events again?
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Mr Deutsche says he isn't sure if the current rate of growth can
          continue. He adds: "When things open up a bit, there will be a natural
          human reaction to be out in the world. There are so many things
          competing for leisure time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And the one thing you can't expand is that time, and people have to
          be selective about where they want to spend it."

        <p>
          Bailey Morrow, an expert on e-sports at Silicon Valley Bank, is more
          confident.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think viewership will continue because we are seeing the
          combination of 5G enabling [better] mobile streaming, popular social
          sites showing e-sports tournaments, and celebrities such as Will Smith
          and Michael Jordan investing," she says.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Additionally, younger generations expect, perhaps demand, virtual
          entertainment easily on their mobile devices."
        </p>
        <p>
          The industry predictions back up Ms Morrow's confidence. The number of
          people around the world watching e-sports is tipped by NewZoo<a
            href="https://newzoo.com/key-numbers"
          >
            to rise a further 9% in 2021 to 474 million, with revenues up 15% to
            $1bn.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Then by 2024, global viewership is tipped to hit 577 million, with
          revenues of $1.6bn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Red Bull's Graham Carroll is certainly bullish. "There will be more
          money, more prize money, more sponsors involved, and more guys
          entering competitions," he says.
        </p>
        <p>"The level will grow, and grow, and grow."</p>
