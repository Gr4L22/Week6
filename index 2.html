          Italian police tracked down Marc Feren Claude Biart, 53, through the
          culinary videos he had uploaded to YouTube.
        </p>
        <p>
          While he carefully hid his face, he failed to disguise his body
          tattoos.

          The alleged member of the 'Ndrangheta crime gang was arrested in the
          Dominican Republic last Wednesday and has now been extradited back to
          Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biart had reportedly been leading a quiet life in the town of Boca
          Chica, police said in a statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been on the run since 2014, when he was wanted by police for
          allegedly trafficking cocaine into the Netherlands on behalf of the
          Cacciola clan of the 'Ndrangheta mafia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'Ndrangheta is considered one of the world's most powerful
          organised crime groups because it controls most of the cocaine
          entering Europe. It is based in Calabria, the region that forms the
          tip of Italy's "boot".
        </p>
        <p>
          The alleged clan boss, Luigi Mancuso, 66, is known as "The Uncle".
          Other members go by nicknames such as "The Wolf", "Fatty" and
          "Blondie".
        </p>
        <p>
          They are all now facing justice in the biggest mafia trial Italy has
          seen in decades. There are 355 alleged mobsters and corrupt officials
          who have been charged after a long investigation into the 'Ndrangheta
          group.
        </p>
        <p>
          During a pre-trial hearing it took more than three hours to read the
          names of the defendants, AFP news agency reported at the time. The
          charge sheet includes murder, drug trafficking, extortion and money
          laundering.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than 900 witnesses are expected to give evidence at the trial,
          which opened in January and will last two years.
